# CS50 Final Project: Pokedex
### by Steven Bruce

<br>

## Description
This application is a database of ***Pokemon***! It has all created Pokemon up through the **Pokemon Sword and Shield** games. The first tab displays basic info, the evolution chain, and the Pokedex entries from each game that the Pokemon has appeared in. The second tab details the Pokemon's abilities and base stats, including graphs to show how each stat compares to the highest possible value for each particular stat. The third tab shows details of every move the Pokemon learns by leveling up or breeding; If the *Learn Level* is listed as 0 for a move, it is an Egg Move. On the fourth and final tab, is a list and details of all the moves a Pokemon can learn through other means. It will display a 1 in the *Move Tutor* column if the move is learned through a move tutor, otherwise it will display the number of the TM or TR that teaches the move. You can navigate it one Pokemon at a time with the left and right arrows, or changing the number at the end of the URL to the Pokedex number of the Pokemon you would like to view.
    *Dex entries, move-sets, etc from **Pokemon Briliant Diamond and Shining Pearl** are included. However, new Pokemon, forms, battle moves, and dex entries from the **Pokemon Legends: Arceus** game are excluded, as I began work on this project prior to the game's release.
    Learnable Moves on the 3rd and 4th tab only include the latest game the Pokemon has appeared in. So for most Pokemon, that was either **Sword/Shield**, or **Briliant Diamond/Shining Pearl**. Any Pokemon that did not appear in Gen 8 at all, shows their moves available from Gen 7 (**Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon**) instead.*
